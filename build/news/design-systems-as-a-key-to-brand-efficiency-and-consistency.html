						<div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-6">
							<p>Design systems have transformed the design and development landscape by standardising elements and workflows, significantly reducing the time needed to market products. They enable a seamless process where designers quickly create prototypes using predefined components, and developers efficiently code these designs. This synergy accelerates the process and encourages innovation and problem-solving.</p>
							<p>In agile development, design systems are invaluable for their speed, allowing rapid prototyping and iteration. Their uniformity streamlines testing and quality assurance, making smoother, more reliable products. More than just design tools, these systems are comprehensive knowledge resources, easing the integration of new team members with immediate access to organisational design philosophies and standards. Design systems are essential for scaling design efforts, speeding up development, fostering efficient collaboration, and ensuring a consistent, high-quality user experience across all platforms.</p>
